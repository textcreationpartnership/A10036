            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:15595:5"/>They ouerturne the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, by their idolatrous ſacrifice of the Maſſe.</p>
            <p>To inſtance in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: Chriſt fare at the table when hee inſtituted his laſt ſupper, and turned his face to his Diſciples the Papiſts ſtand at an Altar, &amp; turne their backes to the people. Chriſt ſpake open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in a plaine manner, the papiſts either whiſper to themſelues, or ſpeake in ſuch a tongue as cannot bee vnderſtood. Chriſt gaue the Sacrament of his body and
<pb facs="tcp:15595:6"/>blood to his Diſciples for to eate and drinke; the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts (vncharitable <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luones</hi>) giue nothing to any man, but eate and drinke all alone. Chriſt miniſtred the myſtery of his body in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bread, the Papiſts mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter printed waſer-cakes. Chriſt miniſtred pure wine, the Papiſts wine (if they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter any) mixt with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Chriſt gaue the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into his Diſciples hands; the Papiſts put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the peoples mouthes, as if their fingers were too baſe. Chriſt deliuered the ſacrament to his Diſciples,
<pb facs="tcp:15595:6"/>ſaying, <hi>Take ye, eate ye, drinke ye:</hi> the Papiſts deliuer it not, but ſay, <hi>Behold, honour, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, reuerence your Maker here:</hi> and then they hang it vp in a pixe, or a boxe, in ſo much, that often in the interim of the prieſts ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, a mouſe creepeth into the boxe, and eateth vp their great Creator. Chriſt gaue the ſacrament vnder both kindes, the Papiſts but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one kinde; they ſteale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the wine. Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Diſciples to eate his Supper in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him, the Papiſts ſay they haue him already
<pb facs="tcp:15595:7"/>in their hands, in their mouthes, in their boxes, in their pixes, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and other ſuch er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours (elſe-where met with-all) hath the diuell brought into the Church of Chriſt by the Papiſts, about the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Sacrament of the body and blood of Chriſt: And (ſuch is their impudency) they ſhame not to father them vpon the word of God, and ancient Fathers; when as both the word of God, and the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ancient Fathers are extreame enemies vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ceaſe to ſpeake how they
<pb facs="tcp:15595:7"/>hinder the liberty and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Word; how they inuert the order of the inſtitution of the Lords Supper, how they peruert the meaning of our Sauiors words, how they trouble the Church with a late de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, but not their leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected errors of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation. Your Ladiſhip cannot bee ignorant how Satan by theſe his helliſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and by all means which they put in practiſe, endeauoureth to pull down the ſides of Gods houſe, that the walls of his owne Chappell might be the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>

            <p>Theſe are the motiues that drewe on this my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to dedicate this my poore labour to your Ladiſhip. In publiſhing it I am ſure to meete with the cenſures of carping readers, who will taxe me much of raſhneſſe: Yet let ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that at the making of the firſt Tabernacle, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as brought <hi>blew ſilk,

How meane ſoeuer it be, if it may any way benefit Gods Church, eſpecially if it may be any ſmall meanes to further you to the right vnderſtanding of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, &amp; to build you vp towards the Kingdome of heauen, I ſhall gaine that I moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
            <p>Thus crauing pardon for my boldneſſe, I commend your Ladiſhip to the Grace of God, who protract your
<pb facs="tcp:15595:11"/>dayes and yeares, according to his graces beſtowed on you; and proſper and finiſh the good work that he hath begunne, by adding that which is yet lacking to your faith and graces, till he haue fitted you vnto, and filled you with glory and immortality. <hi>Amen.</hi>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:15595:19"/>neither was ambition, eaſe, or honour his prouocation to this duty; but it was a buſineſſe and charge committed to him of truſt from the Lord: for the nature of the word <hi>(Receiued)</hi> in this place, ſheweth,<note place="margin">

            <p>This Preface is a forcible reaſon to conuince the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> of their diuiſion amongſt themſelues, and their ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Lords Supper: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they perſwaded themſeluies that the Apoſtle did deliuer his owne, and not the will of the Lord Ieſus, which made them ſo careleſſe of this holy Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet here he tells them that heſpake no otherwiſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered

               <p>A Sacrament is a viſible ſigne of an holy thing, or a viſible forme of an inuiſible Grace: but becauſe in this briefe defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there is ſome darkeneſſe, &amp; many Papiſts and vnskilfull men haue bin deceiued therein: take this as a more fuller definition.</p>
               <p>A Sacrament is an ordinance
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:15595:58"/>of God, whereby Chriſt &amp; al his benefits, in certain viſible ſignes &amp; external rites are repreſented, ſealed, and moſt certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayed to euery Chriſtian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer. I ſay, that a Sacrament is the Ordinance, not of man, but of God, in which by certaine vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſignes, and externall rites, Chriſt &amp; his benefits are ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to euery Chriſtian. For looke as Gods Word is his owne or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, to beget Faith in our hearts, whereby Chriſt and all his benefits, as by a ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, may be apprehended and conuayed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs: Euen ſo Sacraments are ſpeciall Ordinances of God, whereby our Faith (beeing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered and begotten by the operation of Gods Spirit, and the miniſtery of the Word) may bee further increaſed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:15595:59"/>and ſtrengthened, to the end we may bee made more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly partakers of Chriſt and all his benefits to our ſaluation: for Chriſt and his benefits are offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to vs in both; the difference only ſtandeth in this: the word offreth Chriſt to our eares, that we may heare of him, and his redeeming of Mankinde: but the Sacraments offer Chriſt to our ſenſes, Seeing, Feeling, Taſting. As by the miniſterie of the word we heare of Chriſt with our eares; ſo by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we may (as it were) ſee Chriſt with our eyes; feele Chriſt with our hands; and taſte of Chriſt with our mouthes. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, I adde in the laſt place, that as Chriſt and his benefits are repreſented to our ſenſes, ſo he is alſo ſealed, and moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:15595:59"/>conuayed to euery true beleeuer. Heere wee may ſee three moſt notable ends of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That it is an outward ſigne to repreſent, and ſet before our eyes Chriſt and his merits: as circumciſion to the Iewes, was a ſigne of that couenant God made with them in his Sonne Chriſt; namely, that hee would be their God, and they ſhould be his people, &amp;c. So baptiſme and the Lords Supper are much more euident ſignes to vs that are dull of conceite, not onely of the couenant, but alſo of the Mediatour of the couenant, Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Sacrament ſerueth to be a ſeale, to confirme our faith, and to take away all doubtings; and therefore it is called the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:15595:60"/>ſeale of the <hi>Righteouſnes of faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4.11</note> becauſe it certifies a man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and putteth him out of all doubts: As when his Maieſties Highneſſe ſends forth his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents, if wee heare them read, yet ſee not the broad ſeale, we are in ſome doubt; but if we aske for the ſeal, and ſee it, then we are confirmed: Euen ſo our higheſt Prince hath ſent vs his letters patents from heauen, notwithſtanding oftentimes we haue refuſed them, and called them in queſtion: but now in that hee hath together with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſent vs his broad ſeale; yea, his great ſeales the Sacraments, we may then very well reſt our ſelues, and be confirmed.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The Sacrament is alſo an Inſtrument to conuey Chriſt, &amp; his benefits to vs; for wee (like
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:15595:60"/>
                  <hi>Thomas</hi> that wold not beleeue) are not contented till wee ſee, and feele Chriſt: and therefore the Sacrament is a meanes to bring him to vs, if wee haue the hand of faith to receiue him.</p>
               <p>Heere wee are taught in the feare of God,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> not onely to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme highly the Sacraments, but to labour for a true vſe of them, that by the meanes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, wee may fully and aſſuredly bee made partakers of Chriſt. See the vnſpeakeable goodneſſe of God toward vs, how deſirous he is (if we had grace and hearts to conſider it) that wee ſhould not periſh, but beleeue, and ſo come to be ſaued. Hath God contented himſelfe onely with ſpeaking, or ſending vs his word from heauen, that he will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to vs, if we beleeue and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:15595:61"/>repent? (though this had bin ſufficient, hee beeing our King and Prince, and therefore ought not once to call his Word in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.) No verily, but to ſhew his deſire of our good, and to take away all excuſe from vs if we doe not imbrace his mercy: he hath cauſed this Word to be written in a booke for our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, preſerued it in his Church, and conuayed it from hand to hand, from one generation to another; and now at laſt it is come to vs, ſo as daily wee may reade and heare of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And to take away all doubts touching the truth of this word, he hath put to it his broad ſeals, with the inſcription, and Image of Chriſt; that euery way wee might bee made partakers of Chriſt, by Hearing, Seeing, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:15595:61"/>feeling, and ſmelling: In ſo much that if wee doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and beleeue, God may iuſtly complaine of vs, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he did of the Iewes,<note place="margin">Iſai. 5.4.</note> 
                  <hi>What is it that I ſhould do, that I haue not done already to this people?</hi>

               <p>Hauing laid downe the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a Sacrament, what it is, wee will in the next place, ſpeake of the things, whereof the Sacrament of the Lords Supper is inſtituted: and they are Bread and Wine, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances and ſignes of the body, and bloud of Chriſt.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> But why did Chriſt take bread, and chuſe it for this purpoſe, rather then any other

               <p>Now touching their Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, which is a maine pillar of their Religion, and yet is in eſtimation but a fancy or a dreame, it was firſt hatched in the time of Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, in the yeare 1061: when it had but ſmall credit, till Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third came, who gathering a ſwarme of Papiſts together, about the number of 1300. in the yeare 1215. eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed it.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> 1. The firſt is taken from the inſtitution it ſelfe, for therein what did Chriſt take? Bread: what did he bleſſe? Bread: what did he breake? Bread: what did he giue? <note place="margin">ver. 26.27.</note> Bread: and what did his Diſciples receiue? bread: what did they eate? Bread: and after the words of conſecration what did he call his ſupper? ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Bread. Then it muſt of neceſſity bee, that whatſoeuer Chriſt tooke, bleſſed, brake, gaue, conſecrated, and his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:15595:128"/>tooke and eate, was bread and not his body.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is againſt the nature of a Sacrament, that bread ſhould be tranſſubſtantiated into the body of Chriſt; for then the thing ſignifying is conſumed, which makes the Sacrament: &amp; nothing is left, but the thing ſignified, which takes away the nature of it: a Sacrament is no longer a Sacrament, then there is a ſigne to repreſent, as a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne, is ſayd to be no longer a Tauerne, then the buſh hangeth before the doore.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If Chriſts body were really preſent in the Sacrament, then the Sacrament ſhould be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a ſacrifice, which two differ, as much as giuing, and taking: It can be no ſacrifice of Chriſt, for hee offered himſelfe
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:15595:129"/>but once, and that was vpon the croſſe, therefore it is called a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, becauſe it is but a ſigne of his ſacrifice.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If Chriſts body ſhould be eaten in the Sacrament, then ſo often as we eate it, Chriſt ſhould be ſacrificed, his body broken, and his blood ſhed; wee ſhould then crucifie him, as the Iewes did; which is moſt horrible, and fearefull to conſider.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If this their errour; ſhould be holden for a truth, then the damned crue of prophane and wretched ſinners ſhould eate Chriſts fleſh, and be ſaued; as our Sauiour ſpeaketh, <hi>He that eateth my fleſh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 6.54.</note> 
                  <hi>and drinketh my blood, hath life euerlaſting:</hi> Yea, the dumbe and inſenſible creatures ſhould eate the fleſh of Chriſt, as a mouſe or a rat, &amp;c. Which
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:15595:129"/>thing the Councell of <hi>Arelate</hi> fearing, decreed that the Prieſts ſhould be puniſhed, and do pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, if a mouſe, or any other beaſt did eate the body of Chriſt through their negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If Tranſſubſtantiation were certaine, then what became of all our forefathers, the Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Prophets, and other holy men of God, that were before Chriſts being in the fleſh? what ſhould become of many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, the children of beleeuing Parents? Al theſe neuer did eate the fleſh of Chriſt, as corporall meate; and yet they are ſaued: beſides, they did all of them eate Chriſt before his being in the fleſh, as we do, (he being come in the fleſh:) So <hi>Paul</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly telleth vs, <hi>They did all eate the

                  <hi>and drinke the ſame ſpirituall drinke,</hi> which meate and drinke was Chriſt.

               <p n="7">7. If Chriſts body were in the Sacrament, then it muſt bee ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with the mouth, and pulled in pieces with the teeth; then the members of our body ſhold diſmember, and disioynt his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, (which is abſurd to ſpeake, but damnable to practiſe;) then
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:15595:130"/>it were enough to eate Chriſt corporally, being before our eyes in the Sacrament: but in this corporall eating there can be neither <hi>Hope,</hi> nor <hi>Faith:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.24 Heb. 11.1</note> 
                  <hi>Hope is of things not ſeene, and faith is an euidence of things not ſeene, &amp; the ſubſtance hoped for:</hi> but herein the Papiſts can go no further then the things are before their face: when the obiecr is gone, (which is the body of Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſent,) then all their faith and hope decaieth.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If Chriſts body bee in the Sacrament, then, it muſt be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a mortall body, or a glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed body, the one it muſt be. If it be a mortall body, then either Chriſt is not dead as yet, (which is falſe,) or elſe Chriſt is againe ſubiect to mortality, (which cannot bee) but the truth is,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:15595:131"/>Chriſt was dead, is riſen againe, &amp; hath changed his mortal bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy into an immortal body; ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore they cannot receiue a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal body, for Chriſt hath it not to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If it be a glorified bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy, then he is not in heauen, he hath left his ſeate at his Fathers right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; is vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth; which would croſſe the word of truth. As touching his glorified body, the Scripture ſaith, <hi>that Chriſt was receiued vnto heauen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 16.19 Col. 3.1.</note> 
                  <hi>and now ſitteth at the right hand of God.</hi> In another place, <hi>Chriſt departed from his Diſciples,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Act. 1.9.11</note> Againe, <hi>Chriſt was taken vp into heauen.</hi> Therefore this body cannot be in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.
